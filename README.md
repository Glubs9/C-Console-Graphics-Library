# C#-Console-Graphics-Library
a graphics library to use for colour pixel graphics (not images) in the cmd for c#.

To use: download PixelCanvas.cs; then when compiling link it to the original file (if compiling in the console just write it in the compiler. if in visual studio i have no clue)
Note: I have no clue if this works on windows though it probably does

To use in the file import PixelCanvasInclude using the 'using'
eg: using PixelCanvasInclude

then you can call PixelCanvas
